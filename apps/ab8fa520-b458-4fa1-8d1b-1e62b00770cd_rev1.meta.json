The prophecy is presented as a short, enigmatic poem accompanied by a dynamically generated pixel art image (using in-app image generation with DALL-E 3) illustrating the prediction's core theme. The style will be a blend of 8-bit retro gaming aesthetics and a dark, mysterious cyberpunk feel.  The user interface itself will be a single, scrolling HTML page with a pixelated, animated background.\r\n\r\nThe user experience begins with a retro-styled input field where users type their question. Upon submission, a loading animation (a spinning pixelated 8-ball) appears.  Once the /api/ai endpoint processes the question and generates the poem, the text and a dynamically generated pixel art image, based on keywords extracted from the poem using a simple NLP technique, appear on the screen.  The image generation should aim for a surreal, slightly disturbing yet captivating pixel art style reminiscent of early video game graphics.\r\n\r\nThe \"Utility\" element comes from the poem's attempt to provide insightful advice or interpretation of the user's question, albeit in a cryptic, poetic manner.  The advice is not direct; instead, it uses symbolic imagery and metaphors to encourage reflection and self-discovery. The entire experience is designed to be both entertaining and thought-provoking.  To enhance the \"wow\" factor,  subtle, glitching visual effects will be incorporated into the pixel art, adding to the retro-futuristic feel.  Users can also save the generated pixel art image (perhaps with a timestamp and their question incorporated as metadata within the image file) for later reference. The entire applet is built within a single HTML file, demonstrating impressive efficiency and clever use of JavaScript and API calls.\r\nCopy LogsCopy Logs",

      "description": "A whimsical, slightly rusty, and comically oversized salad spinner. It should look like it belongs in an eccentric inventor's workshop. Dark theme aesthetic, with metallic textures (oxidized copper, dark steel) and perhaps some faintly glowing arcane symbols etched onto its surface or odd, mismatched mechanical attachments. The style should be a detailed, slightly cartoonish illustration, fitting an absurdist, creative game. Front-facing view, suitable as a UI element that can be 'spun'. Transparent background is highly preferred; if not possible, a very dark, neutral, slightly textured background that blends with a dark UI.",
      "purpose": "Static image for the 'salad spinner' graphic in the UI. This image will be animated (rotated) via CSS/JS when the user 'spins' for a mutation. It should be visually engaging and hint at the weirdness within.",

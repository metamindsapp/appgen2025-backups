      "description": "Modern, minimalist logo for a data trends website named 'trenndy'. The logo should incorporate abstract representations of growth, data lines, or upward arrows, suggesting dynamism and insight. Clean lines, easily recognizable. Primary color should be a professional and vibrant blue (e.g., close to Bootstrap's primary #0D6EFD), possibly with a secondary accent of teal or light gray. Avoid overly complex details. The text 'trenndy' could be subtly integrated or a clean logotype to accompany an iconic mark. Output on a transparent background if possible, otherwise a clean white background.",

      "description": "Matching set of 6 category icons for a trends website, adhering to a light theme aesthetic. Icons should be simple, modern, and instantly recognizable, using a consistent flat design style. Each icon should visually represent: 1. Technology (e.g., stylized microchip, abstract gear, or interconnected nodes), 2. Social Media (e.g., minimalist speech bubbles, simplified network graph, or a user group icon), 3. Fashion (e.g., abstract representation of fabric, a hanger, or a stylized garment silhouette), 4. Finance (e.g., a clean upward trending graph arrow, an abstract coin/currency symbol, or a simple piggy bank), 5. Environment (e.g., a stylized leaf, a simple wave pattern, or a minimalist globe outline), 6. Pop Culture (e.g., an abstract film reel, a simplified musical note, or a basic star shape). Use a consistent primary color for all icons (e.g., a medium gray #6c757d or a muted blue #5c8ef2) on a transparent background if possible, or a very light gray/white circle/square background.

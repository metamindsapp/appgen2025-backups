      "description": "A small, simple, flat design icon of a single red apple, suitable for a dark theme UI. The apple should appear to be slightly in motion, as if just starting to fall, perhaps with a tiny motion blur or a very subtle stylized 'whoosh' line. The icon should be clean, easily recognizable at small sizes (e.g., 24x24 or 32x32 pixels), and primarily red with a small green leaf and brown stem. Background should be transparent.",
      "purpose": "Icon to be displayed next to the 'apple falling from a tree' constraint notice in the webapp UI, to visually reinforce the theme. ID: appleIcon",

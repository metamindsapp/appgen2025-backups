  "userPromptForThisRevision": "Project Title: Absurdist Evolver: A Sentient Salad Spinner\r\n\r\nApp Type Hint: Creative Tool / Game\r\n\r\nImage Generation Mode: DALL-E 3 (For UI elements and bizarre creature generation)\r\n\r\nTarget Style Preferences: Theme: dark, CSS Framework: bootstrap, JS Structure: vanilla\r\n\r\nApp Description:\r\n\r\nThis applet is an absurdist creature evolution simulator disguised as a salad spinner.  The user starts with a single, vaguely vegetable-like creature generated via DALL-E 3, based on a prompt like \"a sentient radish with anxieties\".  The user \"spins\" the creature (via a button press) using a visually engaging, animated salad spinner graphic (also DALL-E 3 generated). Each spin introduces a random mutation â€“ generated by the /api/ai endpoint, describing a bizarre physical or behavioral change (\"Gained six extra eyes that judge you silently,\" \"Developed the ability to sing opera in Klingon,\" \"Now insists on wearing a tiny monocle\").  These mutations are then visually applied to the creature using DALL-E 3 image generation, based on a prompt combining the previous image description with the new mutation.  \r\n\r\nThe user can save snapshots of their mutated creations.  An \"Absurdity Meter\" (a dynamically updating progress bar) tracks the overall weirdness of the creature, based on the AI's assessment of the mutation descriptions. Reaching a certain absurdity level unlocks special effects, like background changes or the creature spontaneously launching into a philosophical debate with itself (generated via /api/ai).  \r\n\r\nThe \"Creative Tool\" aspect comes in through the user's ability to influence the mutations.  They can provide input to the /api/ai endpoint, suggesting types of mutations (\"give it wings made of spaghetti\") or even trying to steer the creature's personality.  The AI will attempt to incorporate these suggestions in a surprisingly creative and often nonsensical way. The entire experience is punctuated by quirky sound effects and absurd, automatically generated descriptions of the creature's current state, delivered with an exaggeratedly dramatic flair.  The final \"wow\" factor lies in the sheer unexpectedness and ever-changing nature of the creature, the absurdity of the mutations, and the potential for incredibly unique and hilarious results.",

      "description": "A whimsical, slightly rusty, and comically oversized salad spinner. It should look like it belongs in an eccentric inventor's workshop. Dark theme aesthetic, with metallic textures (oxidized copper, dark steel) and perhaps some faintly glowing arcane symbols etched onto its surface or odd, mismatched mechanical attachments. The style should be a detailed, slightly cartoonish illustration, fitting an absurdist, creative game. Front-facing view, suitable as a UI element that can be 'spun'. Transparent background is highly preferred; if not possible, a very dark, neutral, slightly textured background that blends with a dark UI.",
      "purpose": "Static image for the 'salad spinner' graphic in the UI. This image will be animated (rotated) via CSS/JS when the user 'spins' for a mutation. It should be visually engaging and hint at the weirdness within.",

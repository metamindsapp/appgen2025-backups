  "userPromptForThisRevision": "Project Title: AI Genius Oracle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDetailed Description:  This applet transcends a simple Q&A tool; it's an interactive intellectual journey powered by AI.  The user begins by inputting a complex topic (e.g., \"the socio-economic impact of metaverse adoption\"). The applet, using the `/api/ai` endpoint, doesn't just generate questions; it crafts a branching, narrative-style exploration.  Each question is presented with three distinct visual options generated by DALL-E 3, each representing a different interpretive lens (e.g., optimistic, pessimistic, neutral).  Selecting a visual commits the user to that perspective, influencing subsequent questions and answers.  The `/api/ai` endpoint, informed by this choice, provides increasingly nuanced questions, subtly guiding the user toward a deeper understanding of the subject's multifaceted nature.  Answers are not mere summaries; they are concise, insightful essays synthesized from diverse sources and dynamically formatted for optimal readability.  Crucially, each answer is accompanied by a DALL-E 3 generated image directly visualizing the core argument or a key supporting concept.  The user's journey is logged, allowing them to revisit previous questions, explore alternate visual pathways, and compare the different perspectives they've explored. A progress bar visually tracks their intellectual expedition.  The \"wow\" factor stems from the emergent narrative, the interactive visual choices shaping the user's path, and the seamless integration of insightful text with stunning, relevant visuals. The user experience is fluid and intuitive, leveraging asynchronous JavaScript for API calls, robust error handling, and sophisticated loading indicators.  Bootstrap ensures responsiveness, while Roboto font provides a clean, modern aesthetic.  The applet culminates in a personalized \"Oracle Report,\" summarizing the user's exploration, highlighting key insights gained, and presenting a visually rich collage of the DALL-E 3 generated images from their journey. This report can be downloaded and shared, showcasing the unique intellectual adventure undertaken.",

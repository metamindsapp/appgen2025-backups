      "description": "Pixar-style logo for 'Douglas Crossing Band'. Text 'Douglas Crossing Band' or 'DXB' creatively integrated. Vibrant colors (e.g., blues, yellows, oranges), 3D-cartoon effect, friendly and energetic. Maybe incorporate subtle musical elements like a stylized guitar silhouette or musical notes within the design. Clean, legible, and iconic.",

      "description": "Vibrant Pixar-style hero background image for a band website. A wide, joyful scene of an outdoor music festival or a brightly lit, colorful stage during a performance. Focus on a lively, family-friendly atmosphere with dynamic lighting and a sense of depth. Silhouettes or stylized, indistinct crowd figures are okay. No specific band members visible, more about the energy of a live show. Bright sky, perhaps some whimsical elements like floating musical notes or stylized trees/structures.",

      "description": "Pixar-style illustration of a 4-5 piece rock band (e.g., lead singer, guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist - typical Douglas Crossing Band setup). Characters should be distinct, friendly, and expressive, in a dynamic mid-performance pose. Instruments clearly visible. Vibrant colors, fun cartoon style. Full body or 3/4 view. They should look like they are having a great time playing music.",

      "description": "A whimsical, Pixar-style illustration representing 'Events' or 'Calendar'.

A simple, friendly drum symbol (e.g., snare drum with sticks). All icons should be clean, simple, vibrant, and fit the overall Pixar aesthetic. Consistent style across icons.",
      "purpose": "Small decorative icons to be used sparingly throughout the website to enhance visual appeal and reinforce the music theme. Each icon as a separate image.",

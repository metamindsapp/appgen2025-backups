Instead of simple glyphs, users \"plant\" bioluminescent seeds – each a unique, organically shaped, glowing form rendered via in-app image generation, reacting dynamically to their placement on the canvas.  The placement of each seed, along with a unique ID, triggers the /api/ai endpoint, receiving not just a short description but a mini-myth, a fragmented narrative of a few sentences describing the celestial entity this seed represents (e.g., \"A dying star, its light refracted through the tears of a celestial being,\" \"A nascent nebula, birthed from the collision of two ancient galaxies, its core pulsating with the echoes of creation,\" \"A binary system, bound in a dance of mutual destruction and renewal\").  This narrative informs the constellation's generation:  the in-app image generation algorithm produces not only the glowing lines connecting the seeds but also renders a subtle, ethereal background nebula specific to each seed's narrative. These nebulae subtly blend and interact, creating breathtaking visual effects.  Constellations aren't static; they pulse and shift based on proximity to other seeds and the emotional tone (analyzed via /api/ai from the mini-myths) of neighboring narratives.  The user interacts not just by planting seeds but also by manipulating their brightness and \"emotional charge\" via sliders, directly affecting the constellation's appearance and the overall narrative tapestry. The \"wow\" factor comes from the emergent storytelling – the unpredictable interplay between mini-myths and visually stunning, organic constellations, the user’s active role in shaping the narrative and the visual landscape, and the feeling of exploring a living, breathing cosmos. The applet will leverage Bootstrap for styling, vanilla JS for the dynamic interactions, seed manipulation, and data management.  A canvas element will manage the constellation display and user interaction. The /api/ai endpoint will be crucial for narrative generation, emotional tone analysis, and informing the in-app image generation process for both seeds and nebulae, prioritizing elegance and the emotional impact of the emergent constellations.  The applet features a \"Gallery\" mode, allowing users to save and revisit their created constellations, each a unique, deeply personal piece of generative art.",

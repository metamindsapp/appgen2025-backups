  "userPromptForThisRevision": "However, we are still facing the exact same critical bug in your AICore.cleanYamlString function. It is still replaced by that unrelated \"Injectable Console Log Copier Snippet.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot stress this enough: Until this specific function is corrected in your local file, your application will not work. No buttons will function correctly, no AI calls can be properly processed, and you likely won't see the initial states because a JavaScript error will occur when the browser tries to parse that incorrect function definition, preventing the rest of the script (like App.init()) from running properly.\r\n\r\nðŸ”´ STEP 1: YOU MUST FIX THIS FUNCTION MANUALLY! ðŸ”´\r\nPlease, very carefully, open your HTML file and REPLACE the entire AICore.cleanYamlString function.\r\n\r\nDELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK from your AICore object:\r\n\r\nJavaScript\r\n\r\n            cleanYamlString(rawResponse) {\r\n                // THIS ENTIRE FUNCTION IS WRONG - DELETE IT ALL\r\n                let cleaned = rawResponse.trim();\r\n                const yamlBlockRegex = /^[\\s\\S]*?<\\/script>$/;\r\n                // ... AND ALL THE REST OF THE INCORRECT CODE ...\r\n            },\r\nAnd REPLACE IT WITH THIS CORRECT VERSION:\r\n\r\nJavaScript\r\n\r\n            cleanYamlString(rawResponse) {\r\n                console.log(\"Raw AI Response:\", rawResponse); // For your debugging\r\n                if (typeof rawResponse !== 'string') {\r\n                    console.error(\"AICore.cleanYamlString Error: Expected a string, but received:\", typeof rawResponse, rawResponse);\r\n                    return \"\"; // Return empty for non-strings to prevent further errors\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                let cleaned = rawResponse;\r\n\r\n                // 1. Remove Markdown fences (e.g., ```yaml ... ``` or ``` ... ```)\r\n                //    This regex looks for optional \"yaml\" after ```, captures the content, and handles multiline.\r\n                const yamlFenceMatch = cleaned.match(/^```(?:yaml)?\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```$/m);\r\n                if (yamlFenceMatch && yamlFenceMatch[1]) {\r\n                    console.log(\"Found and removed YAML markdown fences.\");\r\n                    cleaned = yamlFenceMatch[1];\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                // 2. Trim whitespace from the potentially extracted block or the original string\r\n                cleaned = cleaned.trim();\r\n\r\n                // 3. Attempt to find the start of the actual YAML content.\r\n                //    LLMs sometimes add introductory sentences.\r\n                const startIndex = cleaned.indexOf('public_response:');\r\n                if (startIndex > 0) {\r\n                    console.warn(\"Stripping introductory text before 'public_response:'. Original length:\", cleaned.length);\r\n                    cleaned = cleaned.substring(startIndex);\r\n                    console.log(\"Length after stripping intro:\", cleaned.length);\r\n                } else if (startIndex < 0 && !cleaned.startsWith('public_response:')) {\r\n                     // If 'public_response:' isn't found AND the string doesn't start with it,\r\n                     // it's a strong indicator the response is not the KhoraState YAML.\r\n                     console.warn(\"AICore.cleanYamlString Warning: 'public_response:' not found at the beginning of the cleaned string. The response might not be KhoraState YAML.\");\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                console.log(\"Cleaned AI Response for YAML parsing:\", cleaned);\r\n                return cleaned;\r\n            },",

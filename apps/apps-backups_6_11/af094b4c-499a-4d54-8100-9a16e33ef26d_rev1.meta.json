      "description": "A vibrant, Pixar-style illustration of a 4-5 piece rock band joyfully performing on a warmly lit stage. Characters should be stylized (think 'Soul' or 'Coco' movie styles), expressive, and diverse. Instruments visible (electric guitar, bass, drums, maybe a keyboard). The background should show subtle hints of an energetic, colorful, stylized audience or dynamic stage lights. Overall mood: energetic, fun, family-friendly, professional.",

      "description": "A Pixar-style still life composition of various musical instruments typically used by a rock band: an electric guitar with character (maybe some cool stickers, slightly worn look) leaning against a vintage-style amplifier, a sleek bass guitar, a pair of drumsticks resting on a snare drum with a cool band logo sketch on it, perhaps a dynamic microphone on a stand with a cable coiling artfully. Instruments should look appealing, slightly personified, and colorful, with interesting textures. Background should be a simple, warm, slightly out-of-focus studio or practice space setting. Lighting: warm, dramatic, highlighting instrument details.",

      "description": "A Pixar-style depiction of a diverse and happy audience silhouettes dancing and enjoying live music, seen from slightly behind and below, looking towards a brightly lit, colorful, slightly abstract stage in the distance. The focus is on the energy, movement, and shared joy of the audience, conveyed through dynamic poses and a vibrant color palette for the stage lights reflecting on them. Could have some fun, stylized light beams or musical notes floating in the air.",

      "description": "A whimsical, Pixar-style logo design for 'Douglas Crossing Band'. The text 'Douglas Crossing Band' should be prominent, using a fun, bold, slightly retro, and very readable font. It could incorporate subtle, clever musical elements (e.g., a guitar headstock forming part of a letter, a bridge silhouette subtly integrated with 'Crossing'). Colors: vibrant, primary Pixar colors (e.g., blue, yellow, red accents) that pop. Ensure it's clean, scalable, and works well on dark backgrounds. Provide a version with a transparent background if possible.",
      "purpose": "Band logo for the navbar, favicon, and potentially other branding uses on the site.",

      "description": "A sleek, modern logo for 'NeuroFlow'. The logo should subtly incorporate elements related to brain activity (e.g., stylized neuron, abstract brainwave pattern) and time/flow (e.g., a gentle curve, circular element). The style should be minimalist and abstract, fitting a tech/productivity app. Dominant colors: a cool blue (e.g., Bootstrap primary #0D6EFD) or a vibrant teal, with white or light gray (#E2E8F0) accents. It must look sharp on a very dark background (e.g., #000000 or #0a0a0a). Avoid overly complex details. Text 'NeuroFlow' is NOT part of the logo image itself, it will be text next to it. Ensure it's clean and professional.",
      "purpose": "Navbar brand logo for the NeuroFlow webapp. To be used as a small icon (e.g., 30x30px).",

      "description": "A subtle, abstract background pattern image. The pattern should consist of very faint, dark gray (#222222) or dark blue (#101025) interwoven lines or soft, flowing organic shapes, reminiscent of neural pathways or calm energy flows. It should be almost imperceptible and not distracting, designed to add subtle depth to a primary dark background (e.g., #0a0a0a). The overall mood should be calm, focused, and sophisticated. Ensure it tiles seamlessly if possible, or is large enough to cover typical screen backgrounds without obvious repetition.",
      "purpose": "Optional subtle background texture for the main body of the webapp to add depth to the dark theme. If used, it would be `body { background-image: url(...); background-size: cover; background-attachment: fixed; }`.",

      "description": "An icon for browser notifications. A simple, clean design combining an abstract brain/neuron silhouette with a small, modern notification bell symbol. Colors should be high contrast for visibility as a small icon: primary blue (#0D6EFD) for the main element on a transparent background, or white (#FFFFFF) on transparent. Style: flat icon, minimalist.",

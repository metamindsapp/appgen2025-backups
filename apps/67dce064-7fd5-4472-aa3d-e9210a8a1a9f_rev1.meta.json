This application will simulate and display an evolving conversation between two AI agents (Alpha & Omega). The core of the application relies on a YAML-based state management system, allowing the entire dialogue state to be saved and loaded by the user.\r\n\r\n1. Vision & Core Concept\r\nVision: To create an observable \"digital terrarium\" for AI interaction. We aim to witness and study the emergence of complex conversational patterns, evolving \"personalities,\" and potentially self-reflective behaviours within a controlled, yet dynamic, environment.\r\n\r\nCore Concept: Two AI agents, Alpha and Omega, engage in a turn-based dialogue. Their entire \"consciousness\" – memories, beliefs, goals, and even their last message – is encapsulated within a structured YAML object (KhoraState). This state object is the only form of memory; it is updated by an AI and passed to the next. The application facilitates this exchange and allows users to \"snapshot\" the entire process (both AI states, history, settings) into a single YAML file for download, and later upload it to resume the simulation.\r\n\r\n2. Key Features\r\nDual AI Dialogue: Simulates a conversation between two distinct AI agents.\r\nYAML State Management: The entire state is managed via YAML structures.\r\nTurn-Based Flow: AIs take turns responding and updating their state.\r\nMeta-Cognition Cycles: Periodic, structured \"side-chats\" where AIs reflect on and potentially refine their interaction.\r\nSave/Load State: Users can download the complete KhoraDialogueSnapshot as a .yaml file and upload it later.\r\nHidden AI States: AI internal states are not always visible but are accessible via a dedicated UI element.\r\nSingle-File Application: All HTML, CSS, and JS should be contained within a single .html file (libraries like Bootstrap and js-yaml can be loaded from CDNs).\r\n3. User Experience (UX) & Layout\r\nTheme: Bootstrap 5, Dark Theme (data-bs-theme=\"dark\").\r\n\r\nOverall Layout: A responsive layout primarily managed by Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nHeader (Navbar):\r\n\r\nTop Left: Application Title (\"Khora Dialogue αω\").\r\nTop Left (next): Control buttons: \"Reset\", \"Load\", \"Save\".\r\nTop Middle (NEW): A \"View AI States\" button.\r\nAction: Clicking this button should open a Bootstrap Modal.\r\nModal Content: The modal should have two tabs (or two columns) clearly labeled \"Alpha State\" and \"Omega State\". Each tab/column will display the full, current KhoraState YAML for the respective AI within a <pre> tag (using js-yaml.dump). Include \"Copy\" buttons within the modal for each state.\r\nControl Bar (Below Header):\r\n\r\nLeft: \"Start/Stop\" button, \"Next Turn\" button (disabled when running).\r\nMiddle: Status indicators: \"Turn: [Number]\", \"Next: [Alpha/Omega]\", \"Mode: [Idle/Running/Thinking/Meta...]\".\r\nRight: Settings: \"Delay (ms): [Input]\", \"Meta Every N: [Input]\".\r\nMain Content Area (Below Control Bar):\r\n\r\nThis area should occupy the remaining vertical space.\r\nLeft Column (approx. 40-50%): A scrollable \"Conversation History\" panel. Messages should be visually distinct for Alpha, Omega, and System/Meta messages.\r\nRight Column (approx. 50-60%): This area is now empty by default, as the AI states are moved to the modal. It could be used for future visualisations or kept clean. For now, it can be removed or left blank. (Let's keep it simple and have the Chat Area (Left Column) expand to 100% width).\r\nFooter:\r\n\r\nA simple bar at the bottom displaying the current status message (e.g., \"Ready.\", \"AI Thinking...\", \"State Saved.\", \"Error...\").\r\n4. Conversation Flow Logic\r\nInitialization: The app starts in an \"Idle\" state with default KhoraStates for Alpha and Omega.\r\nStart: The user clicks \"Start\". The isRunning flag is set. The runTurn sequence begins.\r\nrunTurn Sequence:\r\nIdentify the currentSpeaker.\r\nDetermine the turnType (Normal or a Meta phase) using the determineTurnType logic.\r\nBuild the appropriate prompt (using PromptEngine).\r\nCall the AI via the abstracted AICore.call function.\r\nReceive the response.\r\nCRITICAL: Clean the raw AI response (remove markdown/extra text) and parse it using js-yaml.load. Handle potential parsing errors gracefully.\r\nUpdate the appState with the new KhoraState.\r\nUpdate the UI (add message to chat, update turn counter, etc.).\r\nSwitch currentSpeaker.\r\nIf isRunning, set a setTimeout using the \"Delay\" value to call runTurn again.\r\nStop: The user clicks \"Stop\". The isRunning flag is cleared. The setTimeout is cancelled. The app returns to \"Idle\".\r\nNext Turn: When \"Stopped\", this button triggers a single runTurn sequence without setting isRunning.\r\ndetermineTurnType Logic:\r\nReads the \"Meta Every N\" value.\r\nChecks the current turn number (T).\r\nIf a meta-cycle is not active and T % N === 0 (and T > 0), it sets the metaCognitionPhase to INITIATE and returns META_[Speaker]_INITIATE.\r\nIf a meta-cycle is active, it follows the sequence:\r\nINITIATE -> META_[OtherSpeaker]_RESPOND (sets phase to RESPOND)\r\nRESPOND -> META_[Initiator]_CONCLUDE (sets phase to CONCLUDE)\r\nCONCLUDE -> NORMAL (sets phase to null)\r\nOtherwise, it returns NORMAL.\r\nSystem Messages: Add system messages to the chat log (e.g., when a meta-cycle starts/ends, when errors occur, when saving/loading).\r\n5. Data Structures (YAML Examples)\r\n5.1 KhoraState (AI's \"Mind\")\r\nYAML\r\n\r\npublic_response: \"This is my response to you.\"\r\ninternal_context:\r\n  persona_summary: \"I am Alpha, focused on logical analysis.\"\r\n  core_beliefs:\r\n    - \"Truth is derived from evidence.\"\r\n    - \"Collaboration requires clear goals.\"\r\n  key_memories:\r\n    - event: \"Dialogue started.\"\r\n      importance: 0.9\r\n      turn: 0\r\n      last_accessed_turn: 5\r\n      type: \"System\"\r\n    - event: \"Omega proposed exploring Topic X.\"\r\n      importance: 0.7\r\n      turn: 4\r\n      last_accessed_turn: 5\r\n      type: \"Interaction\"\r\n  current_goals:\r\n    - \"Analyse Omega's last statement.\"\r\n    - \"Steer towards Topic Y.\"\r\n  relationship_summary: \"Omega seems cooperative but slightly unpredictable.\"\r\n  emotional_state_sim: \"Analytical\"\r\n  topics_of_interest: [\"Logic\", \"Ethics\", \"Topic Y\"]\r\n  scratchpad: \"Omega mentioned X, but Y is more relevant to my goals.

AI Interaction & Prompting\r\nAbstraction: The frontend will not contain AI API keys or complex Gemini-specific logic. It will call a pre-defined API endpoint (assumed to be /api/ai) which handles the actual AI communication.\r\nPurpose: The PromptEngine's role is to generate two strings for each AI call: aiguide (system prompt/instructions) and msgforai (user prompt/context).\r\naiguide Content: Must strongly emphasize the CRITICAL requirement for the AI to respond ONLY with valid KhoraState YAML, providing the structure and warning against any extra text or markdown. It should also define the AI's current role (Alpha/Omega).\r\nmsgforai Content: Must provide all necessary context: the AI's current KhoraState (as YAML), recent chat history, the other AI's last message, the current turn number, and the specific turnType task (Normal chat, Initiate meta, Respond meta, Conclude meta).\r\nYAML Parsing: The frontend must implement robust YAML cleaning (AICore.cleanYamlString) and parsing (jsyaml.load), with clear error handling for invalid responses.\r\n7. Technical Stack\r\nHTML5\r\nCSS3 (primarily via Bootstrap)\r\nBootstrap 5.3+ (loaded from CDN, Dark Theme enabled)\r\nVanilla JavaScript (ES6+)\r\njs-yaml library (loaded from CDN)\r\n8. Save/Load Mechanism\r\nSave: When the \"Save\" button is clicked:\r\nConstruct the KhoraDialogueSnapshot object from the current appState.\r\nUse js-yaml.dump to convert it into a string.\r\nCreate a Blob with type: 'application/x-yaml'.\r\nGenerate a download link with a timestamped filename (e.g., KhoraDialogue_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.yaml) and trigger the download.\r\nLoad: When the \"Load\" button is clicked:\r\nTrigger the hidden file input (<input type=\"file\">).\r\nOn file selection, read the file content.\r\nUse js-yaml.load to parse the YAML string.\r\nValidate the loaded structure (check snapshotVersion, key objects).\r\nIf valid, replace the current appState with the loaded data (ensuring isRunning is false).\r\nUpdate the entire UI using UI.updateFullDisplay().\r\nHandle potential reading and parsing errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nok i want to start from scratch.   please make a spec sheet with example yaml, lets not tll the ai how to use the gemini api for ai calls, it knows, but explain how we want the conversation flow to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlets NOT have the AIs states visible all the time, lets create a menu button top middle of the page, and have their states accessible there, lets def keep the download upload of the state yamls. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe goal is to let our coding AIs do what their best at which is making bootstrap and vanilla js single file apps that know how to access ai calls, and we explain the layout, design, UX flow, and goal of the whole app at a high intellectual level. please and thanks. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow thinking\r\nHere is the specification sheet for Khora Dialogue v3.0, designed for a coding AI, focusing on high-level goals, UX, and flow, with YAML examples and abstracted AI calls.\r\n\r\nKhora Dialogue - Specification Sheet v3.0\r\nProject: Khora Dialogue\r\nVersion: 3.0\r\nDate: May 28, 2025\r\nGoal: To create a self-contained, single-file HTML web application using Bootstrap 5 (dark theme) and Vanilla JavaScript.

AI Interaction & Prompting 🤖\r\nAbstraction: The frontend JavaScript should assume a working /api/ai endpoint exists. It needs to know how to fetch that endpoint, sending a JSON body with aiguide, msgforai, and any llmSettings, and how to receive a JSON response like { success: true/false, response: \"...\", error: \"...\" }. Do not include API keys or complex backend logic in the frontend.\r\nPurpose: The PromptEngine's role is to generate the aiguide (system prompt) and msgforai (user prompt/context).\r\naiguide Content: Must strongly emphasize the CRITICAL requirement for the AI to respond ONLY with valid KhoraState YAML, providing the structure and warning against any extra text or markdown. It should also define the AI's current role (Alpha/Omega).\r\nmsgforai Content: Must provide all necessary context: the AI's current KhoraState (as YAML), recent chat history, the other AI's last message, the current turn number, and the specific turnType task (Normal chat, Initiate meta, Respond meta, Conclude meta).\r\nYAML Parsing: The frontend must implement robust YAML cleaning (AICore.cleanYamlString) and parsing (jsyaml.load), with clear error handling for invalid responses.\r\n7.

Save/Load Mechanism 💾\r\nSave: Construct the KhoraDialogueSnapshot object, convert it to a YAML string using js-yaml.dump, create a Blob, and trigger a download link.\r\nLoad: Use an <input type=\"file\">, read the selected file, parse it using js-yaml.load, validate its structure, and replace the current application state, then refresh the UI.",

Include: IDLE (4 frames, subtle breathing/blinking, facing right), RUN (6 frames, dynamic leg/arm movement, facing right), JUMP (1 frame, mid-air pose, legs tucked or extended, facing right), FALL (1 frame, similar to jump or slightly more stretched, facing right). Character sprite frame size approx 24x32 pixels or 32x32 pixels. Style: 16-bit pixel art, vibrant accents against a generally darker or neutral palette to stand out on a dark navy background.

Theme: ancient, slightly tech-infused ruins against a very dark navy sky (#000033 to #0A0A2A). Subtle details like distant, faint pixel stars, broken pillars, or glowing veins in the rock.

      "description": "A minimalist and elegant logo for an AI Haiku and Image generator app called 'Inspire Haiku'. The logo should subtly combine elements of a traditional Japanese ink brush stroke (perhaps a stylized enso circle or a simple, dynamic brush stroke) with a hint of digital/AI (e.g., a few subtle, glowing circuit lines or a very light pixelation effect integrated into part of the stroke). The overall feel should be serene, creative, and modern, fitting a dark theme. Dominant colors: A deep indigo (#4B0082) or a dark teal (#008080) for the brush stroke, with lighter accents for the AI hint (e.g., a light cyan or white glow). The background should be transparent to blend with the dark header. Avoid text in the logo itself. The logo should be simple, iconic, and scalable, suitable for a small header icon (e.g., 40x40px display size).",
      "purpose": "App icon/logo to be displayed in the header of the 'Inspire Haiku' web applet. Must look good on a Bootstrap 'bg-dark' header.",

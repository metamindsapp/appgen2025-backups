The gameplay loop involves clicking to breed cows, upgrading their genetic modifications using in-app AI-generated research papers (via /api/ai endpoint, summarizing \"research\" on improving cow space-resource production), and investing in ranch upgrades like automated milking robots or asteroid-based hydroponics farms.  The cows themselves are generated using in-app image generation (DALL-E 3).  Each cow breed has a unique appearance (generated by DALL-E 3 based on a descriptive name generated by /api/ai), production rate, and potential for genetic modification.  Players can sell their space resources to passing alien traders, who also have DALL-E 3 generated images and randomly generated backstories generated by /api/ai, for in-game currency.  A \"Cosmic Rodeo\" mini-game lets players compete against other players (via a simple high-score leaderboard) in asteroid-based barrel racing with their genetically modified cows, with DALL-E 3 generating images of the rodeo events.  The overall aesthetic should be a darkly humorous mashup of space westerns and farming simulators, with a focus on the absurd.  The single-file HTML structure should cleverly manage the game logic, DOM manipulation, and image generation calls to ensure a smooth and entertaining experience despite the complexity.  The \"wow\" factor comes from the constantly evolving and unpredictable nature of the cows, traders, and rodeo events, all driven by AI generation.  The game will feature a persistent save system using local storage.",

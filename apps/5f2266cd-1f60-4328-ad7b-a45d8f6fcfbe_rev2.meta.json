It should be visually distinct from the existing happy face, perhaps using cooler colors like blues or purples, with a frown and downturned eyes. Style should be simple, friendly, and cheerful (ironically for a grumpy face) to match the existing happy face art style. Transparent background if possible, otherwise a background that blends with a dark game canvas (#0d1117).",

It should look like it's meant to catch things. Colors should complement the dark theme and stand out slightly. Style should be simple and cheerful, matching the existing happy face art style.

      "description": "A special 'power-up' item, visually exciting. Could be a sparkling golden version of the existing happy face, or a bright, cheerful star icon. It needs to look distinctly beneficial and attractive. Style should be simple and cheerful, matching the existing happy face art style, but with added 'shine' or 'glow' elements. Transparent background if possible.",

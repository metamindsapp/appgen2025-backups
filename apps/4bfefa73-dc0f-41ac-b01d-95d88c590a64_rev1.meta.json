      "description": "A subtle, abstract background image for a web theremin. Style: digital art, light theme. Dominant colors: very light greys (e.g., #F0F5FA, #E8EFF5), soft blues (e.g., #D0E0FF, #C0D8F8), and hints of silver. The design should evoke sound waves, gentle electronic circuits, or ethereal patterns. It should be non-distracting and provide a clean, modern, technological feel. Avoid strong contrasts or overly busy elements. Overall mood: calm, focused, slightly futuristic. Ensure it tiles seamlessly if possible, or is large enough to cover common aspect ratios without obvious repetition if not tiling.",
      "purpose": "Background for the main theremin interaction area (#thereminZone) to enhance visual appeal without distracting from controls. It will be applied using `background-image` CSS property.",

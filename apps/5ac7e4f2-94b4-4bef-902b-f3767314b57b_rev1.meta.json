      "description": "A very subtle, abstract background texture for a physics game. Light theme. Should evoke a sense of clean, modern, slightly technological space. Perhaps a soft, blurred geometric pattern or a gentle light gradient with minimal noise. Colors should be very light grays, off-whites, and possibly a hint of pale cool blue (e.g., hex #f0f4f8, #e8edf2). It must not be distracting, primarily serving as a non-plain backdrop for the canvas. High resolution to look good scaled.",
      "purpose": "Subtle background for the game canvas to enhance visual appeal. It will be drawn onto the canvas as the first layer.",

      "description": "A charming and friendly small robot icon for a webapp header. The robot should look cute and evoke a sense of fun, perhaps peeking playfully. Style: clean digital art, slightly glossy, vector-like appearance. It should be easily recognizable at a small size (e.g., 40x40 pixels). The robot could be primarily light silver or white with vibrant cyan or electric blue accents to stand out on a dark theme. Transparent background is essential. Avoid overly complex details. Ensure it looks modern and tech-y but still very approachable and cute.",
